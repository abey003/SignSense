# SignSense

SignSense is a software developed for a mini project aimed at assisting deaf and dumb individuals. It incorporates two main features:
Hand Sign Recognition: This feature allows the software to recognize hand signs shown by users and compare them with pre-trained data to accurately identify the hand sign detected.
Virtual Drawing: This feature enables users to draw virtually by moving a pen in the air over a camera. The software detects the direction of the pen and draws along its path, creating a virtual drawing.
SignSense leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for communication and creativity.
