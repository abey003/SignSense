# SignSense

SignSense is a software developed as part of a college curriculum mini project, aimed at assisting deaf and dumb individuals. It features hand sign recognition, which identifies hand signs shown by users and matches them with pre-trained data, and virtual drawing, which allows users to draw by moving a pen in the air over a camera, with the software detecting the pen's direction and creating a virtual drawing along its path. SignSense leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for communication and creativity.
